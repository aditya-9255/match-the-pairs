# match-the-pairs

A fun game to stimulate memory building activity!

The player clicks on the squares and memorizes the number behind it, in order to match its pair 

Cards are laid out in a grid face down and the player has to take turns flipping pairs of card over

If the two cards match, the player scores a hit

If they do not match, the player loses a move and the two cards are turned back over

The player strives to finish the game in minimum number of moves

The game has three modes:
- Easy (4 x 4)
- Medium (4 x 5)
- Hard (4 x 8)
